# ⏱️ Simple Stopwatch Web Application

This project is Task 2 of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**. I built a sleek, responsive **Stopwatch Web Application** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, which includes key features like dark mode, start/pause/reset functionality, and a modern UI design.

## 🚀 Features

- 🕒 Real-time stopwatch display (HH:MM:SS)
- ✅ Start, Pause, and Reset buttons
- 🌙 Dark Mode toggle for better accessibility
- 💻 Responsive design (works on mobile & desktop)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (including dark mode with transitions)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for logic and interactivity

## 📁 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stopwatch-app.git
